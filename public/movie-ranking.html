<h1>The Best Movies According to Johann</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Founder</h3>
<p>
  This is the story of how the Mc Donald's was founded and how Ray Croc
  influenced the whole fast food industry. Similar to the pursuit of happiness,
  Ray Croc displayed persistence inorder to achieve great heights.
</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>
  Since I started my programming journey, this has been a gem of a movie every
  developer or programmer should watch. This is the story of Mark Zuckerberg
  when he created the very famous app called Facebook which has millions if not
  billions of users.
</p>
<h3>The Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>
  If your stuck in life, and your back against the wall, and everything just
  doesn't seem to work, this movie is for you. Will Smith displayed the power of
  persistence and perseverance in order for you to achieve your goals. Nothing
  good in life comes easy and this is by far the best representation of what
  achieving goal is all about.
